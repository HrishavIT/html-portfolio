<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hrishav Raj Singh</p>
<p>I am a B.TECH second year student</p>
<p>My Branch Specification is - IT(Information Technology)</p>
<p>This is gonna be my first HTML website, i am so excited to make it fully functional as i'm always eager to learn new things . Slowly slowly as i'm getting more into development it is becoming more and more exciting.</p>

<p>This course of full-stack web development is really helping me out , i will try to finish this corse before next summers so that i can apply for summer internships , as that is my goal for now , it is quite difficult to comoplete this course while solving DSA problems too , and if you are a regular gym goer like me , u might understand how much discipline it takes to manage all these things , yet i'll do it as i dont wanna stay AVERAGE.</p>
